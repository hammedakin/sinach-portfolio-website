This helps designers avoid common pitfalls and biases, and allows them to approach the problem from a fresh perspective. The third step is ideating, or coming up with potential solutions to the problem.This involves going beyond basic brainstorming to explore a wide range of potential solutions. <br/> <br/> The fourth step is prototyping, or creating physical or digital models of the potential solutions.Prototyping allows designers to test their assumptions and solve disputes before committing to a final solution. <br/> <br/> The final step is testing the prototype with users.This involves observing users as they interact with the prototype, and gathering feedback to improve the design.Testing ensures that the final product is user - friendly and effective.",
