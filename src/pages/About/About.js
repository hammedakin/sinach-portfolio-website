          <p className="mb-1">
            I'm Osinachi Patrick, a highly experienced product person with a
            wealth of experience working on a variety of products in different
            industries. I am passionate about building and enhancing great user
            experiences and design systems. I approach my work by first
            systematically understanding the problem from the perspective of
            users and the business. <br />
            In addition to my experience in product design, I also have a solid
            familiarity with engineering and technical product management. I
            bring professional training and experience working with some highly
            skilled teams across Fintech, EdTech, Blockchain, RealTech, and
            SaaS. My skillsets include:
          </p>
          <li>
            Strategy & System: User Experience Research, Competitive Analysis,
            Human Centered Design, UX Strategy, Product Thinking, Product
            Lifecycle management
          </li>
          <li>
            Craft & Execution Methods: Product requirements definition,
            Functional Requirements analysis, UX Design, Information
            Architecture, UX Writing/Content Design, Interaction Design, UX
            Auditing, Product Planning, Product Roadmapping
          </li>
          <p>
            I work with a team of professionals to execute any product idea,
            with the goal of the project determining which skills are deployed.
            I have used all of these skills in the various product roles I have
            held in industries such as Fintech, Realtech, and Blockchain. These
            are my areas of expertise, my sweet spots, if you will. <br />
            Throughout my career, I have mostly worked with startups and teams
            in growth phase businesses, taking on a range of roles from creative
            design and UX design to product management. <br />
            When working on a project, I like to first set the context and
            determine the direction, whether working alone or with a team.
            Typically, you can find me managing a product team, designing a
            product or service, or serving as a liaison between the design and
            engineering teams. <br />
            In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, surfing the internet,
            and reading about product development (design/frontend engineering).
