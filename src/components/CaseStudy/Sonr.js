            <h4>About Sonr</h4>
            <h5>üíô¬†Sonr - The Internet Rebuilt for you</h5>
            <p>
              Sonr is a company that operates a blockchain-based platform. A
              blockchain is a decentralised, distributed digital ledger that
              records transactions on multiple computers so that the record
              cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all
              subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network. This makes it
              a secure and transparent way to record and verify transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Sonr's blockchain ecosystem, users have control over their
              digital identity. This means that users have the ability to manage
              their personal information and data, and can choose to share it
              with others or keep it private. They can also use their digital
              identity to authenticate themselves when interacting with the
              platform and its decentralised applications (also known as dApps).
            </p>
            <p>
              Developers, on the other hand, are empowered to build peer-to-peer
              decentralised applications on the Sonr platform. These dApps are
              built on top of the blockchain and use it as a foundation to
              facilitate secure and transparent interactions between users. The
              decentralised nature of the platform means that these dApps are
              not controlled by any single entity, but rather rely on the
              blockchain and the consensus of the network to function.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summary, the goal of Sonr's blockchain ecosystem is to provide
              users with control over their digital identity and to enable
              developers to build decentralised applications that operate
              securely and transparently.
            </p>

            <h4>Sonr Learn Overview</h4>
            <p>
              Sonr Learn is a learning program I worked alongside the Head of
              Developer Relations at Sonr to create inorder to educate people
              about the Sonr Ecosystem. The Sonr Ecosystem is a blockchain-based
              platform that allows users to control their digital identity and
              developers to build decentralized applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sonr Learn is an open-source platform, which means that the source
              code for the platform is available for anyone to view, use, and
              modify. It is designed to provide extensive education about the
              various technologies and products in the Sonr Ecosystem, including
              the blockchain and decentralized applications. To achieve this,
              the Sonr Learn program produces learning content in the form of
              written materials, graphical explanations, and small demo
              projects. These resources are intended to help users understand
              how to use the different technologies and products in the Sonr
              Ecosystem, and to demonstrate their potential applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Sonr Learn program is focused on bringing education about the
              Sonr Ecosystem to the global community, meaning that it is open to
              anyone who is interested in learning about these technologies and
              products. The program is designed to be accessible and engaging,
              and to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Sonr Ecosystem
              for users at all levels of expertise.
            </p>

            <h4>My Role in the team</h4>
            <p>
              As the first member of the developer relations team at the
              company, I played a crucial role in onboarding other team members
              and serving as the product lead, which involved managing
              stakeholders, leading the product design and management process,
              and driving partnership initiatives.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to these responsibilities, I also managed the team and
              played a key role in developing a marketing strategy for our
              platform, including designing content and copy.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was also successful in building relationships with members of
              the local blockchain community and generating enthusiasm for
              working with our team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, my role required a diverse set of skills and
              responsibilities, including stakeholder management, team
              management, product design and management, and driving partnership
              initiatives.

            <h4>Market Reports</h4>

            <p>
              I conducted a research in the current Sonr ecosystem so we can
              identify some elements that will help us drive more impact through
              the program, these were some stuffs I found out.

              From my research I was able to get a mental picture of the ideal
              member of the Sonr Learn program, which I related to the
              stakeholders and was approved as valid.

              This person works as a smart contract developer for a company
              called ‚ÄúUplabs‚Äù. They work remotely with different brands to solve
              problems in the blockchain industry. They use Discord, Twitter,
              Telegram, and LinkedIn to communicate with others. They would like
              to get more involved in the African blockchain ecosystem, but they
              have found that there are not many communities in Africa or
              emerging markets focused on this technology.

            <h4>Information Architecture & Task Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              After understanding the ideal user journey by studying other
              developer learning platform experiences, I designed out an
              information arrangement structure for the platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here I outlined a detailed explanation of the components of the
              program and learning platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Sonr Learn Program offers a wealth of resources for developers
              in the Sonr ecosystem, including learning materials, best
              practices, and guidance on using different tools and workflows. It
              provides a way for developers to deepen their understanding of the
              Sonr ecosystem and learn new skills that can help them be more
              effective and productive in their work.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the key benefits of the program is that it goes beyond the
              documentation to provide different perspectives and approaches to
              development. This can be especially valuable for developers who
              are new to the ecosystem or who are looking to learn more about
              specific tools and workflows.
            </p>
            <p>
              The program also provides resources for students and hackathon
              participants, making it an excellent reference for those who are
              just getting started with development. Additionally, the program
              allows any developer to contribute learning content, giving them
              the opportunity to share their expertise and experiences with
              others in the community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, the Sonr Learn Program has a unified design system that
              ensures a consistent and high-quality user experience across all
              touchpoints. This includes a UI library, brand assets, and content
              illustrations that help to make the learning materials more
              engaging and visually appealing. All of these features combine to
              make the Sonr Learn Program a valuable resource for developers in
              the Sonr ecosystem.

              I worked with the <b> Nebula Design System </b> team to make sure
              the platform was designed in line with the style guide provided by
              the design system. Represented below are some snapshot of the
              styles that was used for this particular project.
