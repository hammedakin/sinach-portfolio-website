        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          The company building the cryptoeconomy for Africa, Stanrute, began in
          2021 with the goal of making it easy for anyone to send and receive
          Bitcoin and stablecoins. Over time, the company has expanded to offer
          a platform for accessing a range of cryptocurrency-based financial
          services. This platform is designed to be user-friendly and reliable,
          making it easier for people to participate in the cryptoeconomy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cryptoeconomy refers to a financial system that is based on
          cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and stablecoins. The goal of the
          cryptoeconomy is to create a more fair, accessible, efficient, and
          transparent financial system. This is achieved through the use of
          decentralised technologies, such as blockchain, which allow for secure
          and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries.
        </p>

        <h3>Market Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          I did a research to learn about our competitive landscape we are
          operating in and the insights about the usability issues. I may not be
          able to to share the reports here because of the NDA signed with the
          company.
        </p>

        <h3>User Interview</h3>
        <p>
          During my ongoing research within the cryptocurrency community, I
          conducted user research interviews to gather insights and identify
          areas for improvement within the already existing products. I have
          been fortunate to have the opportunity to speak with a variety of
          individuals as part of this process, and have conducted both in-person
          and online interviews using Google Forms. The feedback that I have
          received through these interviews has been extremely valuable, and has
          provided a wealth of information and insights that will be
          instrumental in informing my research moving forward. Overall, the
          insights and perspectives that I have gained through these interviews
          have been invaluable, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to
          engage with such a diverse and knowledgeable group of individuals.

        <p>
          There were a lot of other questionnaires I sent out to get some more
          concrete insights during my research about the opportunity I got to
          learn and get a picture of how our ideal users would look like.
        </p>

        <h3>User Persona</h3>
        <p>
          After the user research, I was able to identify an ideal user for the
          app, Philip is a student at the University of Portharcourt who is
          interested in cryptocurrencies and has been trading and learning about
          them for the past two years. He is looking for a brand that can
          provide fast transaction speeds for his cryptocurrency trades. He is
          an entrepreneurial student and values efficiency in his financial
          activities.

            alt="Stanrute_Image"
          />
        </Images>

        <h3>Empathy Mapping</h3>
        <p>
          An empathy map is a tool used in the design process to help designers
          better understand the needs, wants, and motivations of their users.
          The goal of creating an empathy map is to gain a deeper understanding
          of the user's perspective and to use that understanding to inform the
          design of a product or service.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the context of designing the Stanrute app, an empathy map would be
          used to identify and understand the needs, wants, and motivations of
          the users of the app. This could include understanding the user's
          goals, pain points, and any barriers they may face when using the app.
          By creating an empathy map, I as the designer of the Stanrute app can
          ensure that the app is designed to meet the needs of the users and to
          provide a positive and seamless experience.

        <h3>Use Cases</h3>
        <p>
          On the dashboard, the user can see their wallet balance, options to
          deposit, withdraw, or save their funds, and access various features
          such as a cryptocurrency exchange, gift cards, and gamefi (which is
          coming soon). The user can also view news and updates related to
          cryptocurrency and gift cards. In the wallet, the user can deposit and
          withdraw a range of cryptocurrencies, including NGN, USDT, USDC, BUSD,
          ETH, and BTC. They can also view their wallet balance and see the
          "save" feature, which is coming soon. The user can see the different
          cryptocurrencies they have and the corresponding amounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the user clicks on NGN (the Nigerian naira), they see options to
          deposit, withdraw, or sell. Each of these actions has its own process,
          including entering the amount, selecting an agent or merchant to
          transact with, and confirming the transaction. The user can also view
          transaction history for each of these actions. When the user clicks on
          other cryptocurrencies that are not BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, or BUSD,
          they see options to buy or sell. Buying and selling these
          cryptocurrencies involves selecting the coin, specifying the amount,
          and confirming the transaction. For cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH,
          USDT, USDC, and BUSD, the user also has the option to deposit and send
          funds. Depositing involves scanning a QR code, copying a wallet
          address, or inputting a wallet tag. Sending involves specifying the
          amount, inputting the wallet address, and confirming the transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user can also access a feature called "orders" to view their open
          and completed orders, as well as cancel or modify open orders. They
          can also access a feature called "history" to view their transaction
          history. Finally, the user can access a feature called "settings" to
          manage their account, including changing their password, email, and
          phone number, and enabling two-factor authentication.
        </p>

        <h3>Lessons and Way forward</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The app is currently under development and I’m currently managing
            the process of development and planning the launch.
          </li>
          <li>
            During the development, we have been running tests in the process to
            learn more things about the users.
          </li>
          <li>
            The management process has taught me how to manage different
            stakeholders in a Fintech startup.
          </li>
        </ol>

          P.S: I intentionally skipped some processes this case study because of
