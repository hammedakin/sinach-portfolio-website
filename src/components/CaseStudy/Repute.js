            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              Imagine you have a restaurant, after a customer has visited and
              had an experience, they leave a horrible review and 1 star on your
              site.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, you're unable to erase that review or clear your
              business's image before the public and that becomes a problem.
              Leaving that horrible review could disrupt your business's growth
              for a long time. You need that review gone!
            </p>
            <p>
              And for that, we present you a solution with Repute, an app where
              businesses can lodge reports about bad reviews and our lawyers
              work towards taking them down by sending a letter to the reviewer,
              and it is fixed, at an affordable fee.
            </p>
            <p>
              Businesses that want to manage their online reputation across
              their suite of products can sign up with us and periodically
              report reviews they want taken down, we take over from there.

            <h4>My Role</h4>
            <p>
              Worked as one of the Product Managers in the team, collaborated
              with the other Product Managers in the team to deliver this
              product.

            <h4>Understanding the user</h4>
            <h5>Assumption Mapping</h5>
            <p>
              The idea to create this product is based on the following
              assumptions:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Users don't want bad reviews on their business websites or
                  apps.
                </li>
                <li>Users only want great brand identity online.</li>
                <li>Users are willing to pay for good PR service.</li>
                <li>
                  Users want to be able to track bad reviews about their
                  business.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Users don't want to face these customers themselves over the
                  negative reviews.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h5>User Persona</h5>
            <p>
              I worked with the designers to extract insights about the user to
              help us give direction to the solution we are looking at
              delivering.

            <h4>Defining the Problem and Solution</h4>
            <h5>Problem</h5>
            <p>
              The team took note of the rising trend: high profile individual
              and business are becoming more susceptible to negative review,
              where a few words could have a devastating impact on the
              reputation, sales, recruitment efforts of the victim. for this
              reason, the repute vision came to life.
            </p>
            <h5>Solution</h5>
            <p>
              For businesses that want to maintain a great public image, Repute
              is a reputation management app that helps users maintain good
              public relations instead of addressing it themselves and/or
              through other individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
              This would be validated when businesses utilise Repute more than
              other existing alternatives.

                  Working on this product, I’ve learnt that in proffering a
                  solution for a user problem, the interest of the user must be
                  considered at every design stage so as to come up with a
                  usable and functional product for the intended user.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Way forward, we will go on with the user testing on our target
                  audience to ascertain if our solution addresses the real user
                  issues.
