            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              The Refarm app for Field Agents is an application designed to
              facilitate communication and interaction between field agents and
              farmers. Field agents are individuals who work on behalf of Refarm
              and are responsible for a variety of tasks related to the
              collection and distribution of farm produce. These tasks may
              include onboarding new farmers, collecting produce from farms,
              delivering farm inputs to farmers, and providing training to
              farmers on best practices and techniques. The app provides
              features that help field agents to efficiently and effectively
              perform these duties, ensuring a smooth and seamless flow of fresh
              farm produce from farmers to Refarm. Both free and premium users
              (field agents) can use the app.

            <h4>Challenge</h4>
            <p>
              Since the field agents in the farm produce supply chain spend a
              large portion of their time on the road, working to maintain
              excellence in the logistics of the supply chain. In an effort to
              understand the factors that contribute to the success of these
              field agents and determine the most effective way to measure
              efficiency in the supply chain according to the product owners, I
              conducted interviews with stakeholders and identified key areas
              for optimising the app to increase efficiency.

            <h4>The Solution Summary</h4>
            <p>
              The product would be basically designed out to provide a
              comprehensive and efficient platform for field agents to manage
              their tasks related to interacting with and onboarding farmers, as
              well as delivering and obtaining farm inputs. Specifically, the
              app enables field agents to view farmers near them, confirm
              pickups and prices for produce, accept training schedules, log in
              with their official staff email, onboard farmers by collecting and
              verifying their details, view and confirm orders for farm inputs,
              view their activity history and print it out, and explore farmerâ€™s
              listings that are ready for pick and requests for farm inputs on
              behalf of the farmers in their area.
            </p>
            <p>
              This in summary is a simplified monitoring system for the field
              agents activities and interactions with the farmers.

            <h4>Market Research</h4>

            <p>
              The purpose of this market research is to understand the needs and
              preferences of field agents who work with farmers in the
              agricultural sector. Through a combination of surveys, interviews,
              and focus groups, I aim to gather insights on the tasks and
              challenges that field agents face, as well as their expectations
              and preferences when it comes to technology solutions that can
              help them to complete their tasks more efficiently and
              effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on the results of this market research, I will design an app
              that meets the needs and preferences of field agents, including
              features that allow them to view farmers near them, confirm
              pickups and prices for produce, accept training schedules, onboard
              farmers, view and confirm orders for farm inputs, view their
              activity history and print it out, and explore listings and
              requests for farm inputs. By addressing the specific needs and
              preferences of field agents, I aim to create a valuable and
              user-friendly app that will be widely adopted and used and
              integrate so well with the Refarm system.

            <h4>User Persona</h4>

            <p>
              During the process of my research, I worked with the product
              owners to understand the individual characteristics of the field
              agents by conducting a micro-interview on the field agents through
              the product owners, this is a summary of my finding about the
              ideal field agent:

            <h4>Who are our stakeholders</h4>
            <p>
              The key stakeholders in the flow of operations of the Field agents
              app includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Refarm Admin</li>
              <li>Farmers</li>
              <li>The logistics company admin</li>
            </ul>
          </Section>

          <Section>
            <h4>Ideations and Solution Statements</h4>
            <p>
              After interactions with the different stakeholders from the
              insight gotten about the operations and organizational goals, I
              was able to outline a detailed components of the MVP design for
              the Refarm for Field agents app. These are the tasks and the
              functionalities afforded the farmers in the app.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                View farmers near them: This feature allows field agents to see
                a list or map of farmers in their area who have signed up with
                the app. This can help them to identify farmers who they can
                work with and visit.
              </li>
              <li>
                Confirm pickup and price of farm produce: Field agents can use
                this feature to indicate that they are coming to pick up farm
                produce from a farmer, and to agree on the listing price for the
                produce. They can also confirm that they have successfully
                picked up a particular produce from the farmer. This helps to
                ensure that field agents and farmers are clear about the terms
                of the transaction and the status of the produce.
              </li>
              <li>
                Accept training schedules: The app allows the admin to set
                training schedules for field agents to visit and train farmers
                or provide them with advice. Field agents can use this feature
                to view the schedules and accept them as needed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Onboard farmers: Field agents can use this feature to collect
                and verify the details of farmers who are signing up with the
                app. This includes collecting pictures, motorability of the
                road, and land topography. The app will verify the details
                provided by the farmers and send a verification email once they
                have been verified. If the details are not sufficient, the app
                will prompt the farmers to verify their account.
              </li>
              <li>
                View and confirm orders for farm inputs: Field agents can use
                this feature to view orders for farm inputs that have been
                placed by farmers. They can confirm the orders that they will be
                delivering and arrange for delivery to the farmers.
              </li>
              <li>
                View activity history and print it out: Field agents can use
                this feature to view their activity history within the app,
                including their interactions with farmers, deliveries, and other
                tasks. They can also print out their activity history if needed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Explore farm input listings and requests: Field agents can use
                this feature to view listings of farm inputs that are available
                in their area, as well as requests for specific inputs made by
                farmers. This can help them to identify opportunities to deliver
                inputs to farmers or to find inputs that they need for their own
                tasks.

            <h4>Learnings and Way forward</h4>
            <p>
              Here are some learnings that I gained from implementing these
              features in the, as well as some potential ways to improve the app
              based on those learnings:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Understanding user needs and preferences: As the testing of the
                app is done and we gather feedback from field agents, we may
                learn more about their needs and preferences when it comes to
                interacting with farmers and completing tasks. This information
                can help us to improve the app's features and user experience to
                better meet their needs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Identifying pain points and bottlenecks: By using the app and
                collecting data on how field agents are using it, we may
                identify areas where the app is not meeting their needs or where
                there are bottlenecks in their workflow. This information can
                help the team to identify and address any issues that are
                causing frustration or inefficiency for field agents.
              </li>
              <li>
                Evaluating the effectiveness of features: By collecting data on
                how field agents are using the app and the outcomes of their
                tasks, we can evaluate the effectiveness of different features
                and see which ones are most useful to them. This can help us to
                prioritize and improve upon the features that are most valuable
                to field agents.
              </li>
              <li>
                Incorporating new technologies and approaches: As we continue to
                develop and use the app, we may come across new technologies or
                approaches that could improve the app's functionality or user
                experience. By staying up to date on developments in the field,
                we may be able to incorporate these innovations into the app to
                keep it relevant and effective.
